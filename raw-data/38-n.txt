When addressing financial matters in any of our videos, newsletters or other content, we've taken every effort to ensure we accurately represent our programs and their ability to improve your investing skills and enrich your life. However, there is no guarantee that you will get any results or earn any money using any of our methods, tools, strategies or recommendations. This is not a "get rich scheme." Nothing on our site is a promise or guarantee of earnings. Your level of success in attaining similar results is dependent upon many factors including your skill, knowledge, ability, dedication, risk management, awareness of the global economic and political events, and your financial situation, to name a few. Because these factors differ according to individuals, we cannot and do not guarantee your success, income level, or ability to earn revenue. You alone are responsible for your actions and results in life and business. Any forward-looking statements outlined on our site are simply our opinion and thus are not guarantees or promises for actual performance. It should be clear to you that by law we make no guarantees that you will achieve any results from our ideas or models presented on our site, and we offer no professional legal or financial advice.
