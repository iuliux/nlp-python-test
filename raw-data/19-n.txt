Dear Shirley,

First let's get clear exactly what this might mean.  There is no such thing as a 'government income guaranteed' apartment and many spruikers use this term very loosely to inspire confidence in you and to infer that what they are selling to you is, in some way, iron clad - not true!

I can think of only two scenarios where a spruiker might attempt to trade off on some kind of government backing - Defence Housing Australia (DHA) and the National Rental Affordability Scheme (NRAS).
