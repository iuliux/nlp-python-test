Though the previous responses are terse, they are correct. I'm not aware of any investment anywhere that can provide guaranteed income. 10% is actually a pretty high return on investment, and as such it carries a lot of risk. That is, any investment that will give you an average 10% return is likely to fluctuate wildly.

If you're really looking for steady income, you should explore bonds and certificates of deposit and stocks that yield dividends. But these are not going to give you 10% returns.

Based on the question, though, I suspect you could profit from reading some of the great personal finance books that are out there. Start with Bernstein's The Four Pillars of Investing (my review). The author does a great job of exploring the history and psychology of investing, explaining why such concepts as "a guaranteed 10% return" are pipe dreams. He also offers suggestions for generating solid returns with minimal risk.

If anyone promises you 10% returns, they're talking out their ass.
