Investment guarantees are not always what they seem
Investors are being warned to check carefully the small print when buying "guaranteed" investment products that purport to protect your money even if stock markets fall.

Thousands of these products have been sold over the past few years by banks, building societies and insurers to cautious investors who are nervous about putting their money directly into the stock market.
These plans, which typically run for five years, promise to pay a fixed percentage of any stock market gain, but, crucially, most promise to return your capital at the end of this period of market nosedives.
But on some bonds this promise looks set to be broken. Legal & General announced recently that investors are unlikely to get their money back on two of its structured investment plans. More than 2,000 savers have invested a total of £33m in these two six-year plans, which are both due to mature in July 2011.
