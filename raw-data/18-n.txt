Also known as equities, a share represents a share of ownership in a company, and these shares are listed on a stock exchange. When you buy a share, you are buying a small stake in a company. You become a joint-owner of the company along with all the other shareholders, and you are invited to have a say in a number of the decisions the company makes.

When buying shares, the aim is for the shares to grow in value over time; and also to benefit from a share in the profits of the company in the form of regular dividend payments. Shares give investors the opportunity for a steady income and capital growth, although neither of these is guaranteed.
