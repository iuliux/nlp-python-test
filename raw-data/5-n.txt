The investment returns for superannuation are calculated after allowing for income tax on investment income, and investment management expenses but before the deduction of administration fees from members' account balances. Neither the investments of First State Super (of which Health Super is a division) nor payments of capital to members are guaranteed by the Trustee. Past performance is no indicator or guarantee of future performance. The value of investments can rise or fall.
