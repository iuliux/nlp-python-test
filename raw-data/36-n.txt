Guaranteed investment plans called into question
Santander's move to delete the term 'guaranteed' from some of its investment plans has drawn warnings from financial advisers about structured products. Designed to offer a decent return with capital protection, these products often attract cautious savers who can least afford to become a victim when things go wrong.

When is a guarantee not a guarantee? When Santander realises that its products that are supposed to guaranteed may not be covered by the Financial Services Compensation Scheme (FSCS) â€“ two years after it has sold the product to thousands.

The Spanish-owned bank has now written to customers who bought its Guaranteed Capital Plan and Guaranteed Growth Plan structured products between October 2008 and January 2010, following concerns that its marketing of the products as guaranteed had been misleading and investors would not be covered by the FSCS. 

The word 'guarantee' has now been removed and investors have been offered a refund. "There is a lot of confusion over whether the FSCS covers these types of products," said a Santander spokesman. Savers would be covered by misselling or mismanagement but not in the unlikely event that Santander went bust, he added.
