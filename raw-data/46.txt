In the current property and financial climate, sustainable forestry projects offer a low-risk investment opportunity with additional environmental benefits. The Princess project is the only timber investment to offer guaranteed returns* payable in just 5 short years.

The Princess Tree, officially known as Paulownia, is recognized as the fastest growing hardwood in the world. The timber it produces is durable and strong, lightweight and fire resistant. Unlike other Tropical timbers, the demand for Paulownia is not being met by abundance of plantations and, as a carbon reducing facility; it absorbs more CO2 than any other Tropical plantation tree. The world market price, supply and demand, speed of growth and quick return on investment make Paulownia an ideal commercial plantation tree. Moreover, a buyer for the timber has already been found with a bonded purchase guarantee in place, ensuring your investment return is completely guaranteed.
