Trustees of managed superannuation funds are responsible for managing the investment portfolios, so you, unless in a SMSF, need only be concerned with the choice or combinations of investment options to suit your personal circumstances. The options available will be set out in the fund's Product Disclosure Sstatement (PDS), which should explain the nature of the underlying assets, and potential returns and risks. There is often a cost involved with switching from one portfolio to another. However the most common investment portfolios offered by superannuation funds include: 

Capital Guaranteed Investment option: - This investment option usually guarantees the return of net contributions plus interest, once credited to the account. The guarantee is made by the organisation offering the superannuation fund. The guarantee is only as good as the organisation providing it. Funds offering capital guarantees are rare;

Capital Stable/Capital Secure Investment option: - Money invested in this option is usually placed in investments that are 'low' risk (i.e. less volatile) assets, such as fixed interest, etc but may have some exposure - up to about 30% - to the share market. These assets can decrease in value. There are no guarantees offered;

[[ Use of guaranteed in a valid context. It's just explaining the word guarantee. ]]
