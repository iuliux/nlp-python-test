he SCM objective
SCM implements a disciplined investment strategy that emphasises:

    much better returns than property and the stock market; 
    substantially less risk than the stock market - as measured by largest fall and downside volatility;
    the elimination of stock market risk (see No share market risk);
    stable, consistent returns through all market conditions;
    a low volatility investment strategy suited to a wide range of investors and investment periods;
    safety of investment capital (see Safety of your capital);
    excellent liquidity - can be quickly converted into cash if required;
    returns that are derived from intelligent investment selection rather than favourable market conditions; and
    Guaranteed returns that are not reliant on rising asset prices.
