In today's complex world, there are many investment opportunities. Some hold great promise of financial return, while others do not. No matter how you choose to invest your hard-earned money, there will always be a degree of risk involved. Usually, the greater the "promise" of return, the riskier the investment. Often, the investment that sounds like a sure winner is the invention of a con artist and should be avoided altogether.

Each year, Georgians lose millions of dollars to securities, commodities and other types of investment fraud. More than three-quarters of all investment scams are sold over the phone by high-pressure salespeople promoting get-rich-quick schemes. With their slick pitches, con artists will try to cash in on just about any type of investment.

The techniques practiced by these swindlers are well-rehearsed and often hard to resist. To help you outsmart the con artist, Secretary of State Karen Handel has prepared this brochure to offer some insight and advice.
