The Pitch:   This investment has guaranteed high returns - no risk!

The Catch:  There's no such thing - the higher the returns, the higher the risk. This type of sales pitch is often aimed at people who are non-risk takers, particularly those individuals who are on a fixed income or those who are near retirement and are worried about not having a large enough nest egg.  Even with legitimate investments, know the risk level you are taking and invest only what you are willing and can afford to lose.
