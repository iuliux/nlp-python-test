Red Flags To Look For

1. Never invest in a trading fund that is not regulated by the appropriate regulatory body. Thus, a forex investment pool should be regulated by the NFA.

2. Never invest in an opportunity where there is not a complete disclosure of risk. Money can always be lost. Nothing is guaranteed in the world of investments, especially something that is going to yield over 15% per year.

3. Demand trading records and evidence of profitability.

Following these guidelines can help tremendously to avoid falling prey to one of the most common investing schemes of all timeâ€”The Guaranteed Return.
