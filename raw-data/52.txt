The Post Office Fiveyear Saver has been launched, offering customers a guaranteed return on their investment and further opportunities for profit linked to the FTSE 100 Index.

With the Post Office Fiveyear Saver, a fixed term deposit bond over five years is provided and the limited offer is available until January 12th 2007.

The deposit is essentially split in half, with 50 per cent earning 6.25 per cent gross interest per year and the other 50 per cent is tied in with developments in the FTSE 100 Index.

Head of savings and investments at Post Office Richard Norman stated: "Our customers told us that they liked the idea of a balanced investment where they earn a guaranteed return, whilst still having access to the growth potential of the FTSE-100 Index."
