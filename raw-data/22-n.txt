How can I borrow 100% for an investment property?

There are only two ways you can get approval for a 100% investment property loan:

    Investment guarantor loan: If your parents can guarantee your loan using their property as security. Then you can borrow 105% of the purchase price and pay no LMI. You can read more about this on our family guarantee page.
    Using another property as security: If you own another property then you can use the equity in that property as a deposit for your next investment purchase. Effectively you can borrow 100% or 105% of the purchase price.

If you don't have a guarantor or don't have equity in another property, then you can only borrow a maximum of 95% of the property value.
